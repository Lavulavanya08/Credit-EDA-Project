# Credit Default EDA Project

## Objective
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Credit Card Default dataset from Kaggle to understand customer financial behavior and identify key patterns related to default risk.

The goal is to explore the dataset using visualizations and statistical analysis before building any machine learning model.

---

## Dataset Information
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains customer credit details such as:

- Credit limit
- Age and demographic information
- Payment history
- Bill amounts
- Repayment status
- Default payment indicator

Dataset Source: Kaggle Credit Card Default Dataset

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## EDA Steps Performed
- Data loading and understanding structure  
- Checking missing values and duplicates  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Univariate analysis of important features  
- Bivariate analysis with default status  
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps  
- Visualization of payment and bill trends  

---

## Key Insights
- Payment history plays a major role in predicting default.
- Customers with higher bill amounts show higher risk in some cases.
- Certain demographic factors also influence default patterns.

---

## Conclusion
This Exploratory Data Analysis provides useful insights into customer repayment behavior and highlights the most important factors contributing to credit default risk.

---

## Future Work
- Build machine learning models to predict default payments  
- Perform feature engineering for better accuracy  
- Evaluate models using classification metrics
